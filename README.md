# IBM Habit Tracker

This project is a capstone submission for the IBM Flutter course on Coursera. It demonstrates the design and development of a cross-platform habit tracking application using Flutter.

## Project Overview

The IBM Habit Tracker app helps users build and maintain positive habits through an intuitive and engaging interface. The project showcases the following key features and deliverables:

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration screens for new and returning users.
- **Home Screen**: Central dashboard displaying user habits and progress.
- **Habit Management**: Add, edit, and delete habits with persistent storage.
- **Notifications**: Local notifications to remind users about their habits.
- **Settings Menu**: Customizable settings for user preferences.
- **API Integration**: Demonstrates integration with external APIs (see evidence folder).
- **Responsive UI**: Works across Android, iOS, web, and desktop platforms.

## Evidence & Documentation

The `evidence/` and `UserStories/` folders contain:
- Screenshots of the app UI and features
- Figma design references
- User stories and requirements
- Evidence of API integration, persistence, and notification features
